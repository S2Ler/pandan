## Contributing

GitHub Issues is for reporting bugs, discussing features and general feedback in `pandan`. Be sure to check our past issues before opening any new issues.

If you are posting about a crash, a stack trace is helpful, but additional context, in the form of code and explanation, is necessary to be of any use.
